# Stable-Diffusion-Transformer
Text to Image Generator using Stable Diffusion Transformer from Hugging Face.
![alt text](https://github.com/sashe101/Stable-Diffusion-Transformer/blob/main/StableDiffusion-op.png)
This project provides a simple interface for generating images from text prompts using the Stable Diffusion Transformer from Hugging Face. 
Users can input text prompts, and the model will generate an image based on the provided prompt.
# Installation
Before running the code, you need to install the required dependencies. You can install them using pip:
!pip install diffusers transformers gradio matplotlib
# Dependencies
diffusers - Library for using diffusion models
transformers - Hugging Face's transformers library
gradio - Library for creating simple UIs for machine learning models
matplotlib - Library for creating visualizations in Python
